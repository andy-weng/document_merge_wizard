function myFunction() {
  // Tracking a few random thoughts on things we might improve in future versions
  // 1) Fix PDF saving when selecting email and save
  // 2) See if there is a way to scrub things like periods or other problematic characters from filenames automatically
  // 3) See if there is a way to maintain formatting when merging, e.g., merge $49,211 instead of 49211
  // 4) For the automatic filename generation, remove options like blank columns, email, cc, bcc, and attachment columns
  // 5) Generate a summary report that is saved in the folder specified where the PDFs and Docs are saved that shows any line errors (for example if an email address is invalid)
  // 6) Make a progress bar that updates for each row completed. The script already detects how many rows are being merged, so we just need a way for it to update in real time
  // 7) Maybe it could detect which columns are likely the email, cc, bcc, and attachment columns and pre-populate (but still allow the user to change)
